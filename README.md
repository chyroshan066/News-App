# News App

News App that fetches latest relevant news allowing the users to choose categories.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app running.

<br>To create React app through CRA, run the following command:
``` js
npx create-react-app "AppName"
```
The execution speed of the program created through create-react-app (CRA) is slow compared to that of vite. CRA is used to create those app which is bit complex and large.
<br>You can even create react app through vite. Run the following command if you want to create react app via vite;
``` js
npm create vite@latest
```
This create the app. After that you need to write the project & package name (you can even skip this part).
<br>Then choose the required framework using which you intend to build this app.
<br>Then choose the desired variant (Here you have 4 options: TypeScript, TypeScript with compiler, JavaScript & JavaScript with compiler).

Then run the following commands to navigate to the folder:
``` js
cd "folder_name"
```
Install all necessary packages using the following command;
``` js
npm install
```
**OR**
``` js
npm i
```
Then start the app using the following command;
``` js
npm run start
```
On following the link provided, you get to see the sample app.
<br>If you ever intend to change the command for runnig the code, you can do that by making some changes in the package.json file.
